# TheEthicalEngine-
The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing. As it is too late to relinquish control to the car's passengers, the car needs to make a decision based on the facts available about the situation.


The idea of Moral Machines is based on the Trolley Dilemma, a ﬁctional scenario presenting a decision maker with a moral dilemma: choosing ”the lesser of two evils”. The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing. As it is too late to relinquish control to the car’s passengers, the car needs to make a decision based on the facts available about the situation. Figure 1 shows an example scenario. In this project, you will create an Ethical Engine, a program designed to explore diﬀerent scenarios, build an algorithm to decide between the life of the car’s passengers vs. the life of the pedestrians, audit your decision-making algorithm through simulations, and allow users of your program to judge the outcomes themselves.
